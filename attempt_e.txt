this chapter explored the last two major core object types—the tuple and the file. we
learned that tuples support all the usual sequence operations, have just a few methods,
do not allow any in-place changes because they are immutable, and are extended by
the named tuple type. we also learned that files are returned by the built-in open func-
tion and provide methods for reading and writing data.
along the way we explored how to translate python objects to and from strings for
storing in files, and we looked at the pickle , json , and struct modules for advanced
roles (object serialization and binary data). finally, we wrapped up by reviewing some
properties common to all object types (e.g., shared references) and went through a list
of common mistakes (“gotchas”) in the object type domain.
in the next part of this book, we’ll shift gears, turning to the topic of statement syntax—
the way you code processing logic in your scripts. along the way, this next part explores
all of python’s basic procedural statements. the next chapter kicks off this topic with
an introduction to python’s general syntax model, which is applicable to all statement
types. before moving on, though, take the chapter quiz, and then work through the
end-of-part lab exercises to review type concepts. statements largely just create and
process objects, so make sure you’ve master
